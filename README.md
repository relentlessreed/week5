# week5 Work Scheduler

<h1>Work Scheduler</h1>

Here is a scheduling application designed to help you with your 9 to 5.
When you input a reminder on a containers text field, it will be saved to your local storage and upon page refresh/reopen will display your reminder to help... remind you! If the time of a container is in the past, it will be colored grey, if in the present it will be red and if in the future, it will be green.
